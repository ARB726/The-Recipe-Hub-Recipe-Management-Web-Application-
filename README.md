# The Recipe Hub
This Recipe Management Application is a personal project developed to showcase my skills in frontend and backend web development. This application allows users to browse, filter, and view detailed recipes through a clean and interactive interface. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating responsive layouts and dynamic functionality. Key features include intuitive navigation, dynamic filtering, form validation, and an organized structure for displaying recipes.

On the backend, I implemented a server using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database for storing and managing recipe data. The backend handles CRUD operations efficiently and is designed to ensure seamless interaction between the server and the database. While the application was run locally on a personal machine during development, it provides a robust foundation for future enhancements.

This project highlights my ability to integrate frontend and backend technologies, emphasizing clean design, modular code, and functionality. It serves as an example of my passion for creating practical, user-friendly web applications and demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development tools and practices.
